Cluster-Similarity version 0.0.1

Computes the similarity of two word clusterings using several
clustering similarity measures.

Consider for eg. the following groupings:

clustering_1: { {a, b, c}, {d, e, f} }
clustering_2: { {a, b}, {c, d, e}, {f} }

Cluster similarity measures provide a numerical value helping to
assess the alikeness of these two groupings.

All cluster similarity measures implemented in this module are based
on the so-called contingency table of the two classifications
(clusterings). The contingency table is a matrix with a cell for each
pair of classes (one from each classification), containing the number
of objects present in both classes.

The similarity measures are taken from Chapter 4 of Susanne
Schulte im Walde's Phd thesis:

Sabine Schulte im Walde. Experiments on the Automatic Induction of
German Semantic Verb Classes. PhD thesis, Institut für Maschinelle
Sprachverarbeitung, Universität Stuttgart, 2003. Published as AIMS
Report 9(2).
